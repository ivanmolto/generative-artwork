## DESCRIPTION

I felt inspired by Edvard Munch's "The Scream" work.
I was looking for a way to allow people to go deep into their own crypto experiences. And let them immerse themselves in some form of tension but also a playful state.

The vertical gradient of green and red (trading colors) is overshadowed by layers of brushes. The brushes are complex composite shapes based on a colors palette from "The Scream".

I would love to think that _Crypto Roller Coaster Scream_ is the ultimate image for the anxieties of our crypto age. 

With ups and downs not only by trading, but also while holding and building.
And the FOMO of being in or out of the "gradient".

The black depth is the brutal absense of emotions while not being in the play.

Love to work with the intersection of code and creative thinking!


## TECHNIQUES USED

Generative algorithmic art on top of the HTML5 Canvas API.

A palette of colors based on Edvard Munch's "The Scream".
Brushes of complex shapes are distributed over a random gaussian frequency.

On the background is a vertical green/red trading gradient with black depth.

This is not only digital generative art but it can also be plotted physically.

After experimenting I got the feeling that I wanted to share and set a fixed seed to the random to deliver the snapshot / NFT "as is".
